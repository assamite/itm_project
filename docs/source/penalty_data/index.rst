This section covers the compression of files given during the course by the 
groups taking the course. It should be noted that most of these files are passed
as is from compressor to decompressor, as short inspection of the files did not 
reveal any regularities in the data. Notable exceptions are :doc:`group_stock`,
:doc:`monty_python_data1` and :doc:`monty_python_data_2`, the last two being 
files submitted by the group itself.
