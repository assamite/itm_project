This section covers the compression of files given during the course by the 
groups taking the course. It should be noted that most of these files are passed
as is from compressor to decompressor using :command:`cat`, as short inspection of the files did not 
reveal any regularities in the data. Notable exceptions are in :doc:`group.stock`
and :doc:`monty_python_data`, the latter covering files submitted 
by the group itself.
