This section covers the compression of files given during the course by the 
groups taking the course. It should be noted that most of these files are passed
as is from compressor to decompressor using :command:`cat`. This was done because 
short inspection of the files done by unpacking them in different basic data types (byte, short,
int, float, etc.) did not reveal any obvious regularities. Notable exceptions 
are in :doc:`group.stock` and :doc:`monty_python_data`, the latter covering files 
submitted by the group itself.
